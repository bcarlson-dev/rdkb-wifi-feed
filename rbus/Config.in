    config RBUS_INCLUDE_SAMPLES
        bool "Build sample applications"
        default n
        help
        Include sample applications in the build.
        These are useful for development and testing but not
        required for production use.
        
        Sample apps like:
        - rbusSampleProvider/Consumer
        - rbusEventProvider/Consumer
        - rbusMethodProvider/Consumer

    config RBUS_INCLUDE_TEST_APPS
        bool "Build test applications"
        default n
        help
        Include test applications in the build.
        These are more extensive test utilities.
        
        Test apps like:
        - rbusTestProvider/Consumer
        - rbusTestMultiProvider/Consumer
        - Various stress test utilities

    config RBUS_ENABLE_DEBUG
        bool "Enable debug build"
        default n
        help
        Build with debug symbols and verbose logging.
        Uses CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug instead of Release.
        This will increase binary size and may impact performance.

    config RBUS_RTROUTED_AUTO_START
        bool "Auto-start rtrouted daemon"
        default y
        help
        Automatically start the rtrouted daemon at boot.
        This is required for rbus communication to work.
